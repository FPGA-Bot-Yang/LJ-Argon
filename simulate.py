## Basic program structure (to be implemented):

# Create 864 atom objects

# Give them random positions and momenta (applying Boltzmann distribution @ T)

# Allow them to move according to some time step

# Integrate, find new positions and momenta

# Repeat until finished.

# Analyze results (create velocity autocorrelation function and from this, compute material properties)
