LJ-Argon
--------

A [molecular dynamics (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulation of liquid argon. The details of the simulation can be found in A. Rahman's 1964 paper, "Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon". In summary, 864 point masses interacting with a Lennard-Jones potential and obeying classical equations of motion are simulated.
